### News

Major version updates are finally here! It's been awhile, but we're a small team that's been pushing this for awhile. Thanks to several users' PRs, we were able to cherry-pick a lot from the dev branch to push this release out. We decided because of the amount of dependencies that needed to be updated- we would overshoot some of the changes made on the dev branch and just grab the most pressing ones.

Next steps for us will be revisiting the dev branch, revisiting outstanding PRs and RFCs (like Immutable), and also plugging away at a create-react-app spinoff for react-boilerplate.

### Main


 - **Upgrade Webpack to v4** (@julienben @stern-shawn)
  - Syntax / function changes (mode, optimization, etc.)
  - Remove webpack loader syntax from main app
  - Better SVG handling
- **Upgrade Redux to v4** (@gretzky)
- **Upgrade React to v16** (@blling @gretzky)
